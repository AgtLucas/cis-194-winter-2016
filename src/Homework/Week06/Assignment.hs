-- to be O(n) we have to retain previous calculations
-- so recursion passing a map or container is what we need to do
-- and we cant compute things going off in two par recursions because we have to share the same map/container
-- goFib ( n , [(0,0),(1,1)] ).....
-- goFib n priors =  lookup n priors
--                   if found in priors then done
--                   otherwise compute fib for n-2 and then n-1  storing both in priors container
